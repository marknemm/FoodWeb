  <p>
    This Cookie Policy explains how WNY Food Web, Inc ("<strong>Company</strong>", "<strong>we</strong>", "<strong>us</strong>", and "<strong>our</strong>")
    uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our websites at <a href="https://www.wnyfoodweb.com">www.wnyfoodweb.com</a>,
    ("<strong>Websites</strong>"). It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.
  </p>

  <p>In some cases we may use cookies to collect personal information, or that becomes personal information if we combine it with other information.</p>

  <h3>What are cookies?</h3>

  <p>
    Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by
    website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, WNY Food Web, Inc) are called "first party cookies".
    Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third party cookies". Third party cookies enable third
    party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g. like advertising, interactive content
    and analytics). The parties that set these third party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the
    website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.
  </p>

  <h3>Why do we use cookies?</h3>

  <p>
    We use first and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites to
    operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track
    and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Online Properties. Third parties serve cookies
    through our Websites for advertising, analytics and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.
  </p>

  <p>
    The specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are
    described below (please note that the specific cookies served may vary depending on the specific Online Properties you visit).
  </p>

  <h3>How can I control cookies?</h3>

  <p>
    You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our website though your access to some
    functionality and areas of our website may be restricted. You may also set or amend your web browser controls to
    accept or refuse cookies. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from
    browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser's help menu for more information.
  </p>

  <p>
    The specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described in the sub-section(s) below
    (please note that the specific cookies served may vary depending on the specific Online Properties you visit).
  </p>

  <h4 class="strong-underline">Essential website cookies:</h4>

  <p>
    These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our Websites
    and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas.
  </p>

  <h3>What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?</h3>

  <p>
    Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use other, similar
    technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These are tiny
    graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Websites or
    opened an e-mail including them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page
    within a website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to the
    website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure
    the success of e-mail marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function
    properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.
  </p>

  <h3>Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?</h3>

  <p>
    Websites may also use so-called "Flash Cookies" (also known as Local Shared Objects or "LSOs") to, among
    other things, collect and store information about your use of our services, fraud prevention and for other site
    operations.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash
    player to block Flash Cookies storage using the tools contained in the
    <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html">Website Storage Settings Panel</a>.
    You can also control Flash Cookies by going to the
    <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html">Global Storage Settings Panel</a>
    and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash Cookies
    (referred to "information" on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked,
    and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash Cookies that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are
    on at the time).
  </p>

  <p>
    Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash Cookies may
    reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in
    connection with our services or online content.
  </p>

  <h3>Do you serve targeted advertising?</h3>

  <p>
    Third parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile device to serve advertising through our Websites. These companies may use
    information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and
    services that you may be interested in. They may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of
    advertisements. This can be accomplished by them using cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits
    to this and other sites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services of potential interest to
    you. The information collected through this process does not enable us or them to identify your name, contact details
    or other details that directly identify you unless you choose to provide these.
  </p>

  <h3>How often will you update this Cookie Policy?</h3>

  <p>
    We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to
    the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Policy
    regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.
